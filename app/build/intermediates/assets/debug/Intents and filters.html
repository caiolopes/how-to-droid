              	An <em class="wordasword">intent</em> is an abstract description of an operation to be performed. It can be used with startActivity to launch an Activity, broadcastIntent to send it to any interested BroadcastReceiver components, and startService(Intent) or bindService(Intent, ServiceConnection, int) to communicate with a background Service.

				An Intent provides a facility for performing late runtime binding between the code in different applications. Its most significant use is in the launching of activities, where it can be thought of as the glue between activities. It is basically a passive data structure holding an abstract description of an action to be performed.                  
               </p>
               <p>
                  Intents are objects of the
                  <code class="code">android.content.Intent</code>
                  type. Your code can send them to the
                  Android system defining the
                  components you are targeting. For example, via
                  the
                  <code class="code">startActivity()</code>
                  method you can define that the intent should be used to start an
                  activity.
                  
               </p>

                  An
                  intent
                  can contain data via a
                  <code class="code">Bundle</code>. This data can be used by the receiving
                  component.

                  To start an activity,
                  use the method
                  <code class="code">startActivity(Intent)</code>. This method is defined on the
                  <code class="code">Context</code>
                  object which
                  <code class="code">Activity</code>

                  The following code demonstrates how you can start another

                  Activities which are started by other Android activities are
                  called
                  <em class="wordasword">sub-activities</em>. This wording makes it easier to describe which activity is meant.

                  via intents.
                  Use the

                  method call
                  for that.
